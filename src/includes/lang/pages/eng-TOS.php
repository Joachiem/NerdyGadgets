    '1.1-tos' => '<p> ICTWaarborg uses consumer-friendly general terms and conditions. This means that they are written as clearly and comprehensibly as possible and do not limit the rights of the consumer in any way.
    All members of ICTWaarborg must, when doing business with a consumer, apply the conditions set out below. In some cases, for example when they are a member of the Dutch Thuiswinkel Organization or Stichting Webshop Keurmerk, it may be that they apply the conditions of those organizations.
    This is only possible with a so-called distance selling (see the explanation to Article 10).</p>',

    '2-tos' => '<p>General</p>',

    '2.1-tos' => '<p><h1>Terms and conditions are often rightly seen as difficult "fine print". That is why we try to speak in understandable language in these terms and conditions about matters such as price, delivery time, time of payment and what exactly is being delivered. Because not everyone is aware of the content of the legal procedure that applies to a purchase agreement, we start with a brief explanation of your legal rights as a buyer. </h1>
    <br>
    <h1> The person who supplies you with a product or a service (for the sake of convenience we then refer to "seller" in these terms and conditions) is required by law that what he supplies possessing the properties that a buyer may expect under the ( purchase) agreement that he has concluded with the seller (this is called conformity). The type of product and the statements that the seller has made about it play a role in this, for example about special properties of the product. Incidentally, it is wise to record such matters separately in writing for the sake of clarity.
        The buyer may also rely on advertisements from the manufacturer, unless the seller has expressly stated that he does not agree with those statements. For the record, we have included a declaration of conformity in Article 7. </h1>
    <br>
    <h1> If it turns out that the product does not have the properties that could be expected on the basis of the purchase agreement, the buyer can - in addition to all other rights that the law grants him / her (for example, deferment of payment) - demand from the seller:
        delivery of what is missing;
        repair of the defects, unless this is impossible or cannot be required of the seller;
        or replacement, unless this is impossible or cannot be required of the seller. </h1>
    <br>
    <h1> The seller may refuse repair or replacement if the costs thereof are disproportionate to other reasonable solutions, for example reduction of the purchase price or refund of the purchase price and compensation for any damage suffered.</h1></p>',


    '3-tos' => '<h1>Article 1. All agreements in writing </h1>',

    '3.1-tos' => '<p> We strive to record in writing as much as possible our agreements about the price, characteristics of the product to be delivered, delivery time, time of payment, etc.
    Additional agreements (for example about hardware and software that are supplied with a PC / notebook in addition to a standard configuration or in deviation from a standard configuration) are also laid down in writing.
    Agreements regarding repairs are also recorded in writing.</p>',

    2. During the period that the offer applies, the prices of the products / services offered will not be increased, except if they are the result of legal regulations (this includes, for example
    the VAT rate). <br>
    3. If it concerns a price increase from 3 months after we have concluded the agreement with you, you can cancel this agreement with effect from the day on which the price increase takes effect. <br>
    4. An exception applies to prices that are related to fluctuations in the financial market over which we have no influence.
    In that case we can offer variable prices, but if that is the case, we will state in the offer that it concerns target prices that are linked to the fluctuations in the financial market.<br> </h1>',

    '6.1-tos' => '<h1>
    We offer various payment methods, which may vary from time to time. You will receive an invoice from us upon payment. Just like you, we have our payment obligations. If you postpone your payment, we will incur costs.

    '7.1-tos' => '<h1>
    1. Naturally, we strive to always deliver at the agreed time. This will be done as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days, unless a shorter or longer delivery period has been agreed.
    If delivery is still late, and there is no question of force majeure, then you as the buyer - if it has been agreed that you would pay at the same time - have the right to postpone payment until delivery has been made.
    If you wish, you can dissolve the purchase agreement in whole or in part in the event of late delivery, except when the seriousness of the exceeding of the delivery period does not justify this. <br>
    2. Delivery takes place at the address you have given us. If delivery is delayed, or if an order or service cannot or only partially be executed, you will be notified as soon as possible.
    The deadline for this is 30 days after you have concluded the (purchase) agreement. After this period you have the right to terminate the agreement without costs and you are entitled to any compensation. <br>
    3. After dissolution, we will refund the amount you have paid as soon as possible, but no later than 14 days after dissolution. <br>
    4. If the delivery of a separately ordered product proves to be impossible, we will do our best to provide you with a replacement item. This will be reported in a clear and comprehensible manner at the latest at the time of delivery.
    If it concerns a distance purchase (see article 10), you can still use your right of withdrawal. In that case, the costs of return shipment are for our account. <br>
    5. The risk of damage and / or loss of products rests with us until the moment of delivery to you or to a third party designated by you, unless you have chosen a delivery method that we do not offer as standard.<br></h1>',

    '12-tos' => '<h1>Article 10. Buy at a distance</h1>',

    '12.1-tos' => '<h1>
    In a so-called distance contract, usually referred to as a distance purchase (for example, an order from a web store), special additional rules apply that we have included separately in this article.

That therefore applies not only to purchases via the internet (web shops), but also telephone or written orders are covered by us
    the concept of distance selling. <br>

An e-mail is also seen as a durable data carrier. If you have already received the information in this way before concluding the agreement, this is sufficient and the information does not have to be provided again.</h1>',
